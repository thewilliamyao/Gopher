1. Pre-created logins:
Email: joanne@gmail.com
Password: test
2. You can switch the user type: foodie or cook
at the Profile page. Userâ€™s information can also
be edited by clicking the edit icon. Also, the profile
page keeps track of your Gopher points, number of meals 
sold and number of meals bought. When you are in login in
,if you enter the invalid email address, the button will
shake to inform.
3. As a foodie: (restricted to buy one meal each time)
   On the map view, you can see the posted meals
   and click on them to see the detail.
   On the list view, you can see all the posted 
   meals and click on any of them to see further
   details. After that, you can click Order on the
   Food Details page to order it. The cook will notify
   you when the meal is ready. If your ordered meal is
   not ready when you open this app, a notification will
   tell you if your ordered food is ready as well.
   On the third tab, you get to see the pending 
   meal and have the option of canceling it.
4. As a cook:(restricted to post one meal each time)
   On the map view, you can see all the foodies and
   clicking on them shows you the details. When you 
   press add button on the right bottom, you can post 
   a meal and indicate whenever it is ready. We will notify
   you. In addition, by clicking on the plus floating button 
   in list view, you can post a meal as well. Both of 
   these two methods check if a cook has posted a meal
   already; if so, an alert will pop up to notify a meal is
   posted. As default, the meal is not bought and ready yet, 
   so once it is ready, you can go to the third tab to mark it as
   ready.
   On the list view, again, you can see all the foodies
   near you and can post a meal by clicking on the plus
   floating button.
   On the third tab, you can see what meal you are cooking
   right now. Plus, you can either Mark this meal as ready
   or Delete the meal. Once the meal is ordered, you can mark
   the meal as ready and mark the meal as picked up. Once picked
   up, it will not be in the list any more. Then the cook 
   and the foodie are free again to sell/ buy what they want.

Note: We did not deal with saving/loading images. We attempted 
to encode bitmap images to 64-bit strings to store into firebase,
but the memory usage for the app was too high and led to constant crashing. 
In the future, we can use an image hosting service and load images from a url.
